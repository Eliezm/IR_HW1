The characteristics of the 10 most frequent terms in the document collection are mostly stop-words, which makes sense because they are used to connect different parts of a sentence, are integral to the grammar of the language, and because of that, appear in almost every sentence. Also, the word "said" appears among them, which can be because it's a verb we use a lot, especially in text when we want to address others by saying what they said using this verb.

In contrast, the 10 least frequent terms in the index are numbers in a strange format (having 0000 before the number itself), and it makes sense that they appear in a low number of documents because of the formatting and because they are numbers, which usually donâ€™t show up very often.
